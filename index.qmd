Greetings! I'm a doctoral candidate at the University Laval's [Department of Finance, Insurance and Real Estate](https://www4.fsa.ulaval.ca/etudiant/simon-pierre-boucher/), where I'm pursuing a PhD in finance. My main area of research and academic focus is on econometric methods related to time series, high-frequency data modeling, and the impact of macroeconomic announcements, as well as commodity financialization.

To study high-frequency financial data, I rely on the programming language R as my primary tool. At present, I'm working on my thesis, and I'm excited to be making progress on this significant research undertaking.
