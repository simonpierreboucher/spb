## 

In this chapter, we will present a measure allowing us to quantify the quality of our regression. We will start with the following three definitions:

**Total Sum of Squares**

$$SST=\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\overline{y})^2$$

**Regression Sum of Squares**

$$SSR=\sum_{i=1}^n(\hat{y}_i-\overline{y})^2$$

**Error Sum of Squares**

$$SSE=\sum_{i=1}^n(\hat{y}_i-y_i)^2$$

The last three definitions can be related in the following equation

$$\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\overline{y})^2=\sum_{i=1}^n(\hat{y}_i-\overline{y})^2+\sum_{i=1}^n(\hat{y}_i-y_i)^2$$Or in an equivalent way

$$SST=SSR+SSE$$

One of the most used measures is the coefficient of determination, which can be found as follows

$$R^2=\frac{SSR}{SST}=1-\frac{SSE}{SST}$$Moreover, by construction, $R^2$ will take a value between 0 and 1.:$$R^2 \in (0,1)$$
