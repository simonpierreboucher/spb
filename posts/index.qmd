This R script is designed to plot a budget constraint and an indifference curve for an intertemporal choice scenario within the context of financial theory. Initially, the script defines incomes for two periods (\`y0\` and \`y1\`), as well as the interest rate. It then calculates the total available amount for consumption (\`W0\`) by accounting for the interest rate to discount the income from year 1. This calculation ensures that the future value of money is appropriately adjusted for present value.

Subsequently, the script generates a linear budget constraint that illustrates how consumption in year 0 and year 1 must adjust to stay within the total budget. This is depicted by plotting \`x_ajuste\` against \`y_ajuste\`, where these variables represent consumption in year 0 and year 1, respectively, adjusted across 100 points to demonstrate the trade-off between present and future consumption.

Moreover, the script employs a logarithmic utility function to calculate and plot an indifference curve. This curve represents combinations of consumption between years 0 and 1 that provide the same level of utility. To do this, it first calculates a feasible level of utility (\`utilite_realisable\`) using a selected budget point (\`c0_budget\`, \`c1_budget\`) as a reference. Then, it plots a series of points (\`c0_points_filtered\`, \`c1_points_filtered\`) that achieve this fixed level of utility across different consumption mixes.

The final plot visually compares these two crucial concepts in financial theory: the linear budget constraint (in blue) and the curved indifference line (in red), against a backdrop of possible consumption choices in years 0 and 1. The plot effectively demonstrates the trade-offs and decision-making process involved in intertemporal consumption planning, highlighting the impact of interest rates on present and future consumption choices.
