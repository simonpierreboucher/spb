Initially, the script defines incomes for two periods (\\`y0\\` and \\`y1\\`), as well as the interest rate. It then calculates the total available amount for consumption (\\`W0\\`) by accounting for the interest rate to discount the income from year 1. This calculation ensures that the future value of money is appropriately adjusted for present value.\n\nSubsequently, the script generates a linear budget constraint that illustrates how consumption in year 0 and year 1 must adjust to stay within the total budget. This is depicted by plotting \\`x_ajuste\\` against \\`y_ajuste\\`, where these variables represent consumption in year 0 and year 1, respectively, adjusted across 100 points to demonstrate the trade-off between present and future consumption.\n\nMoreover, the script employs a logarithmic utility function to calculate and plot an indifference curve. This curve represents combinations of consumption between years 0 and 1 that provide the same level of utility. To do this, it first calculates a feasible level of utility (\\`utilite_realisable\\`) using a selected budget point (\\`c0_budget\\`, \\`c1_budget\\`) as a reference. Then, it plots a series of points (\\`c0_points_filtered\\`, \\`c1_points_filtered\\`) that achieve this fixed level of utility across different consumption mixes.\n\nThe final plot visually compares these two crucial concepts in financial theory: the linear budget constraint (in blue) and the curved indifference line (in red), against a backdrop of possible consumption choices in years 0 and 1. The plot effectively demonstrates the trade-offs and decision-making process involved in intertemporal consumption planning, highlighting the impact of interest rates on present and future consumption choices.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# GSF-6028\n# THÉORIE FINANCIERE\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ny0=500\ny1=500\ntaux_interet=0.05\n\nW0 <- y0 + y1 / (1 + taux_interet)\n\n\nx_ajuste <- seq(0, W0, length.out = 100)  \ny_ajuste <- (W0 - x_ajuste) * (1 + taux_interet)  \n\n\n\n\ndf <- data.frame(x_ajuste, y_ajuste)\n\nc0_budget <- W0 / 2\nc1_budget <- (W0 - c0_budget) * (1 + taux_interet)\nutilite_log <- function(c0, c1) {\n\n  return(log(c0) + (1/(1+taux_interet))*log(c1))\n}\n\nutilite_realisable <- utilite_log(c0_budget, c1_budget)\n\ntrouver_c1_pour_utilite_fixe <- function(c0, utilite_fixe) {\n  f <- function(c1) utilite_log(c0, c1) - utilite_fixe\n  tryCatch({\n    return(uniroot(f, c(0.1, W0))$root)\n  }, error=function(e) {\n    return(NaN)\n  })\n}\n\nc0_points <- seq(0, 1000, by = 10)\nc1_points_realisable <- sapply(c0_points, function(c0) trouver_c1_pour_utilite_fixe(c0, utilite_realisable))\n\nc0_points_filtered <- c0_points[!is.nan(c1_points_realisable)]\nc1_points_filtered <- c1_points_realisable[!is.nan(c1_points_realisable)]\n\nplot(c0_points_filtered, c1_points_filtered, type = \"l\", col = \"red\", \n     xlab = \"Consommation année 0 (y0)\", ylab = \"Consommation année 1 (y1)\",\n     main = \"Contrainte de Richesse et Courbe d'Indifférence Ajustée\",xlim = c(0,1000),ylim = c(0,1000),lwd=3)\nlines(x_ajuste,y_ajuste,lwd=3,col=\"blue\")\ngrid()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
